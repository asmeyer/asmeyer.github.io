	<p>About me: I am a graduate student in the <a href="https://mcmahonlab.usc.edu/">McMahon Lab</a>and am fascinated by the cell population dynamics, and cell plasticity and diversity. I am also highly interested in computational biology and the applications to single cell population data. I hope to pursue a career where I can investigate cell population dynamics using both wet and dry lab skills.</p>
	<p>Before deciding on a PhD program, I worked in order to broaden my research knowledge and skills, as well as to help figure out what I wanted to pursue. Initially, I trained in molecular ecology and evolution. I was always fascinated by how different forces were interacting to drive communities and population dynamics. After finishing my undergraduate studies in the Helms Cahan lab at the University of Vermont, I stayed in my department teaching biology labs and working as a technician for the Helms Cahan lab. After, a year I decided to leave NE and the northeast and headed west. I joined the <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Research/Research-Labs/Svendsen-Lab/">Svendsen Lab</a>, where I worked as a Research Associate investigating sporadic ALS and Parkinson’s disease using novel patient derived <a href="https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/comments/S2213-6711(18)30103-6#secsectitle0030">neurovascular unit models</a> . It was here where I discovered my passion for cellular dynamics at the tissue and systematics level. Inspired by my work and my mentors I decided to pursue a PhD in molecular and computational biology at the University of Southern California. Now, I am working on research investigating inter-organ protein communication networks and am highly interested in using big data and informatics to tease apart systematic level biological questions. In the future I hope to work in an research intense environment both in wet and dry lab. </p>
